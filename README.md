# Pagination

We have a list of contacts (name, email, etc), such as that which can be found in the index.html file.

The project can be viewed here:
[https://call900913.github.io/js-rchristy-pagination/](https://call900913.github.io/js-rchristy-pagination/)

It began with a long list: the list in its entirety.

I broke it apart into pages of 10s and added page numbers at the bottom.

I Also added a search feature on the top right hand corner.
